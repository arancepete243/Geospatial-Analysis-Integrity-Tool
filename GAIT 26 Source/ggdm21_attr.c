"The functional classification code for facilities as specified by DIA Manual (DIAM) 65-3-1 and encoded by the data element CATEGORY as required by DoD Directive 5105.21.   [Description] Function classification codes provide a hierarchical structure for defining the detailed purpose of a facility. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) defines a facility as 'a real property performing a unique function and consisting of one or more of the following components: buildings, structures or equipment', for example: storage tanks or a pumping house. The JCS defines an installation as 'a group of facilities, or facility, in a specific geographic area which support a general functional purpose', for example: a petroleum production plant composed of all of its associated refining operations, blending operations, pumping houses and storage tanks all located within the fence line of the petroleum plant.   [Structure] A five character numeric code with each successive numeric character, reading from left to right, further specifying details regarding the function of the facility. The first position breaks down facilities into nine major groups. Subsequent numeric characters extend or delineate the concept further. A zero is used to generalize the function of the facility when the specific function can not be determined. For example, the value '23331' denotes 'Steel Production, Electric Furnace shops, Electroslag Remelt Furnace shops' whereas the value '23300' denotes the more generalized functional classification 'Steel Production'.",

"The dimension of a feature taken perpendicular to its primary alignment of use and generally in the horizontal plane.   [Description] The primary alignment of a feature is its established direction of flow or use (for example: a road, a power line right-of-way, a river, rapid, and/or a bridge). A feature-specific rule may apply. In the case of a bridge, the width is the distance perpendicular to the bridge centre-line and generally in the horizontal plane. In the case of a dam, the width is the distance perpendicular to (across the) the dam crest. If no such direction of flow or use exists then (1) if the feature is irregular in shape its width is taken perpendicular to the direction of its greatest horizontal dimension (see Attribute: 'Greatest Horizontal Extent'), else (2) if the feature is regular in shape then a shape-specific rule may apply: for a rectangular feature, the length of the shorter axis; for a round feature, the diameter.\n\nUnit of Measure: Metre",
