"A boundary between administratively controlled regions.",
"An administratively subordinate division of a geopolitical entity.   [Description] A geopolitical entity (country) is typically divided into first-, second-, and lower-order administrative divisions. First-order administrative divisions are immediately subordinate to the government of the geopolitical entity, with second- and lower-order divisions subordinate to those above them. Examples: (first-order) a United States state, a German Land, a French region; a Canadian province; (second-order) a U.S. county, a French department; (third-order) a U.S. township, a French arrondissement; (lower-levels) a French commune.",
"A basin, usually artificial, in which air is mixed with partially treated wastewater.   [Description] The water is treated with microorganisms to consume organic materials and convert suspended solids to settleable solids that are later collected by a settling pond and removed as sludge.",
"An electronic communications device that is designed for emitting and/or sensing electromagnetic energy.   [Description] For example, used to transmit and/or receive electronic signals as on a radio tower or to capture electromagnetic energy as in radio astronomy. Field-deployable aerials are also included.",
"A collection of aerials that are collocated and serve a common purpose.   [Description] They may be organized either to function as a single larger virtual device (for example: a phased array) or function relatively independently of each other (for example: pointed in different directions and operating at different frequencies as at a satellite communication ground station).",
"A fixed beacon used to indicate the location of an aerodrome from the air.",
"A ground-based piece of electronic equipment, with its supporting structure, that provides aeronautical navigation guidance information or position data.",
"A building for housing aircraft.",
"A small tract of level ground serving as a stage that is surrounded by rising slopes (either naturally occurring or artificially constructed) supporting tiered seating (for example: benches).   [Description] Generally oval or circular in overall shape and typically used for live theatrical presentations, concerts, opera or dance productions, cinema, and/or other stage productions.",
"A predominantly man-made facility equipped with recreational devices.",
"A large structure located in an amusement park.",
"A heavy object, kept in place on the seafloor by its weight and possibly with flukes, to which is attached a cable, rope, or chain that keeps a floating structure (for example, a buoy) on the waterbody surface positioned within a narrow region.",
"An area of relatively uniform water depth with no cables, pipelines, or hazardous obstructions present on the seafloor, in which vessels anchor or may anchor.   [Description] Anchorage areas are additionally determined by: the depth of water in comparison to the tidal range; the material of the seafloor bottom; local environmental effects of wind and currents; and proximity to hazards to navigation, adjacent ships, and harbour traffic lanes. Although the anchorage refers to an identified area along the water surface, its physical structure is considered to be the material and condition of the seafloor below. An anchorage can be physically damaged by natural events (for example: an earthquake or tsunami) by which the preferred seafloor bottom type can change, or hazardous obstructions can be created or moved into the anchorage area.",
"A location at which text pertaining to that location is annotated.   [Description] For example, a characteristic or activity pertaining to the location may be described.",
"A site and related facilities (for example: buildings and/or radar equipment) for storing and launching anti-aircraft artillery.   [Description] Walls, if any, that surround the site are typically used as the basis for delineation.",
"A defined area, on a land aerodrome/heliport, intended to accommodate aircraft/helicopters for purposes of loading and unloading passengers, mail or cargo, and for fuelling, parking or maintenance.",
"A region of waterborne cellular or vascular plants (for example: algae, grasses, reeds, and water hyacinths).   [Description] The vegetation may moored (for example: sea grass and reeds) or floating (for example: sargasso and water hyacinths).",
"An artificial waterway or conduit that is designed to transport water from a remote source, usually by gravity, to another location in order to provide a regular or controlled freshwater supply.   [Description] An aqueduct may be supported by a bridge in order to cross an obstacle, such as a ravine or valley. Aqueducts should be distinguished from ditches and navigable canals. Ditches may be similar in size to aqueducts, but are used for irrigation and/or drainage purposes. Navigable canals, which are typically larger than aqueducts, are constructed for or used to allow the passage of vessels inland.",
"Area of numerous pipes or artificial channels designed to transport water from a remote source(s), usually by gravity, for freshwater supply, agricultural, and/or industrial use.",
"An underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock or unconsolidated materials (for example: gravel, sand, silt, or clay).   [Description] It may yield economically significant quantities of groundwater to wells and springs.",
"A covered pedestrian route composed of arches and pillars, usually open along one or both sides.",
"A site where remains of past civilizations or human activity have been discovered.",
"A natural accumulation of liquid asphalt.",
"A building designed and equipped (for example: with a telescope) for making observations of celestial objects (including the earth in relation to them), of space, and of the universe as a whole.   [Description] Typically incorporates a dome-shaped covering that may be opened in order to expose instruments to the sky or closed to protect them from the weather.",
"A roofed farm building designed for sheltering harvested crops (for example: hay), livestock (for example: cattle), and/or farm machinery (for example: tractors and ploughs).",
"A gate that impounds water within a basin or chamber that is used by watercraft.   [Description] For example, gates used at locks or dry docks.",
"On a shore, the area on which the waves break and over which shore debris (for example: sand, shingle, and/or pebbles) accumulate.   [Description] A beach includes backshore and foreshore.",
"A location on a beach suitable for the landing of troops and vehicles.",
"A representation of the three dimensional relief of the beach along a line or series of connected lines.",
"A reference mark on a permanent object indicating elevation relative to an established datum.",
"A named or numbered place where a vessel is moored at a wharf.",
"A large outdoor board for advertisements.   [Description] May be attached to another structure or self-supporting. Usually elevated so as to be seen for a significant distance.",
"A smelting furnace in which a blast of air is used, especially one for iron-smelting using a compressed hot air blast.",
"A permanently wet area of land consisting of incompletely decayed organic material and mainly stagnant fresh water.   [Description] It is generally too soft to bear the weight of any heavy body. A subtype of the more generalized wetland.",
"An excavation drilled into the ground for purposes other than the extraction of potable water, oil, gas or brine.   [Description] For example, drilled to support the underground testing of munitions, for coring or sampling of bedrock or ice for scientific purposes, or drilled for the injection of waste material.",
"A culturally designated tract where plants are displayed.",
"A region of a waterbody bottom that is homogeneous with respect to a measurement (for example: consistency, colour, and/or composition).",
"A marker identifying the location of a surveyed boundary line.",
"A structure that connects two locations and provides for the passage of a transportation route (for example: a road or a railway) over a terrain obstacle (for example: a waterbody, a gully, and/or a road).   [Description] A bridge consists of a set of two abutments and/or zero or more bridge piers joined by bridge spans. A bridge may serve, for example, as an overpass or a viaduct. In the context of a bridge, the scope of the term 'transportation route' includes the transportation of liquids or gases by means of either pipelines or aqueducts.",
"A pillar or abutment that supports a bridge span.",

"An area where heaped material (for example: waste or spoil) is deposited.   [Description] Waste heaps may be located at disposal sites or in unsanctioned and unprepared locations where illegal dumping takes place. Illegal dumping sites are usually composed of materials produced in the immediately surrounding area; for example, in a residential neighbourhood their content would principally be household trash. Illegal dumping sites have no associated structures or facilities.",
"An aerodrome intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure and surface movement of aircraft on water.",
"A tower-like structure associated with a dam or water source and used for the intake of water.",
"A location at which water-related measurements are taken.   [Description] Water measurements include, for example: water chemistry and/or quality; water depth, volume or velocity; and water presence variability or seasonality.",
"A structure that uses a water wheel or turbine to drive a mechanical process (for example: grinding grain into flour, cutting timber into lumber, or stripping bark from trees for use in tanning).   [Description] A water mill that only generates electricity is more usually termed a 'hydroelectric plant'.",
"A location at which currents, tides, and/or other types of water movement are specified.",
"An artificial channel for a current of water, especially one built to provide water for industrial or agricultural purposes or for transporting water-borne materials.   [Description] For example, a sluice, a flume, or a tailrace.",
"A tower supporting an elevated storage tank of water.",
"A tract for the treatment of water that consists of a bed of material where water is aerated or filtered.",
"A disturbance of water caused by the interaction of any combination of waves, currents, eddies, tidal streams, wind, shoals, and obstructions.",
"A shaft sunk into the ground to reach and tap a supply of water intended for uses other than power generation, heating or the extraction of minerals.   [Description] May be, for example, drilled to tap deep underground reservoirs or dug to reach a shallow water table. Dug wells are typically circular, lined with masonry, have a stone border and a structure built above then for lowering and raising a bucket.",
"Area of numerous shafts sunk into the ground to reach and tap supply(s) of water intended for uses other than power generation, heating or the extraction of minerals.",
"An artificial structure subdividing a waterbody.   [Description] May consist of an artificial earthen embankment subdividing a pond or rice paddy, or an artificial partition (constructed, for example, from concrete or steel) subdividing a fish hatchery tank or water treatment plant aeration tank.",
"A vertically descending part of a watercourse where it falls from a height (for example: over a rock or a precipice).   [Description] In place names, commonly shortened to 'fall' or 'falls', for example, 'Niagara Falls'.",
"An establishment for storing, purifying, and supplying an area or town with water.",
"A collection of windmotors that are collocated and are organized as a single power generation unit.",
"A tower and associated equipment that generates electrical power from wind.",
"A system of wind-driven vanes, and the tower by which it is supported, that are used to produce mechanical power.   [Description] Often used to pump water from an underground location to the surface. Wind turbines that generate electricity are excluded.",
"The ruined remains of a stranded or sunken vessel that has been rendered useless.",
"A site where wild animals are kept for exhibition to the public, that may also support breeding and/or study."
