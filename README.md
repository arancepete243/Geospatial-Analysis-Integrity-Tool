# Geospatial-Analysis-Integrity-Tool
The Geospatial Analysis Integrity Tool (GAIT) validates data against a data model. GAIT checks geometry, feature codes, attribute values and domains, and metadata. The tool writes its results as line and point shapefiles to an output directory. GAIT can execute against data in MGCP, GIFD, TDS, and VMap data models.

### Origin

The GAIT Tool was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)  under a Government contract. The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the MIT license.

As-is warranty is covered within the MIT license but it's re-stated here for clarity: The GAIT tool contains several software components. The software is provided "as is," and no warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for particular purpose or arising by statute or otherwise in law or from a course of dealing or usage in trade, is made with respect to the accuracy or functioning of the software. Neither NGA or IDA are liable for any claims, losses, or damages arising from or connected with the use of the software. The user's sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the software.
